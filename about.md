Welcome to my website. Here is a little bit about myself.

# Study Card

* Swift
* Java
* Data Structures
* [Kalman Filters (Bayesian Perspective)](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/cs287-fa12/optreadings/Arulampalam_etal_2002.pdf)
* [Data Cleaning](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Cleaning-Ihab-F-Ilyas/dp/1450371531)

It's probably weird to see why I have programming languages on my study card, but it is because I am using them to work on separate projects. Additionally, learning different programming languages and paradigms is never a bad thing.

For Data Cleaning and Kalman filtering, we will also have separate streams where we go over implementing them on real datasets.

# FAQ

**What is this blog about?**
We cover many topics on our Twitch streams. Most people don't have the time to sit through an entire 4-5 hour stream, and so I want to create a secondary place for them to get access to the information we covered if they want to. I won't turn everything into a blog, but anything important will be transposed into notes and uploaded here. Please see the study card for what we are currently studying, or see the categories to search what we have studied previously.

**Will you upload code to GitHub?**
Any code we complete on stream will be uploaded to my [github](https://github.com/Shahsquatch).

**How often do you stream on Twitch?**
*Almost* every day, depending on other work I need to complete off stream.

**Do all streams have commentary?**
I like to talk over my streams because I find that explaining concepts out loud helps solidify them in memory. Additionally it keeps me honest as to whether I truly understand them or not.

Sometimes I will not feel like talking though,  and at that point you can enjoy a large dose of royalty free music.

**Are you a data scientist?**
Not in the traditional sense. Rather I'm just some guy that likes learning about statistics, math and programming.

**Are there prerequisites?**
I will try to make the streams as easy to understand as possible, but it would take too long to go through the fundamentals every time. A working knowledge of probability theory and statistics will go a long way. 

I am **not** a computer scientist so all of my software engineering material will be at a more novice level.

**How old are you?**
30, with a 95% confidence interval of \[20, 40\]

**Do you do anything else?**
Since corona I have gotten into calisthenics, and have a few physical goals I am currently trying to reach.

5 minute mile
20 consecutive dead hang pullups
10s handstand
Front Lever

Additionally I intersperse bursts of cacophonous violin playing every week when I feel like it.

**Do you have a job?**
...no comment.

**What's with the monkey?**
I couldn't find a logo of an actual Sasquatch, and couldn't be bothered to make one myself, so the closest relative available in the public domain had to do.




<!-- Hi! Glad to see you here. I'm [Thi](https://dinhanhthi.com). I created this site firstly for my personal note taking and now, I wanna share it with you. For me, people cannot remember everything, you must take note what you have learnt. It's useful if you can put your note online and you are able to see it everytime, everywhere with just a phone. That's the reason why this theme was born. 

I modified this theme much from the theme MatJek so that you can use it for note taking. Please read [Welcome to NoteTheme]({{ site.baseurl }}/welcome-to-notetheme) for more information and [How to use NoteTheme]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-to-use-notetheme) to know how to use and modify this theme for your purpose.
